# Session Summary - August 18, 2025 21:25

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Authentication Issues Resolved
- **Missing Refresh Token**: Added `refresh_token` field to Token model in `/backend/models/user.py`
- **Permission Mismatch**: Changed frontend from "network:view" to "view_network" in `/web-app/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Backend Response Issue**: Modified endpoints to return dict directly instead of JSONResponse

### 2. Network Data Loading Verified
- Successfully uploaded and loaded KET site data:
  - 1575 poles
  - 2810 conductors  
  - 1280 connections
  - 1 generation site (KET_05_M111D substation)

## Test Results
- **AUTH-002** (Login Success): ✅ PASS - Fixed with refresh token and permission updates
- **AUTH-004** (Protected Route): ✅ PASS - Fixed with permission string update
- All authentication endpoints verified working via Python urllib
