# 1PWR Grid Platform - Field Team Feedback Request
## Pilot Test Results: Ketane (KET) Site

---

## Executive Summary

The new 1PWR Grid Platform has successfully completed its first pilot test using real data from the Ketane (KET) site. The system processed **1,574 poles** and **94.2 km of conductors**, demonstrating end-to-end functionality from data import through network validation.

### Key Achievements:
- âœ… **Data Import**: Successfully imported Excel data from uGridPLAN
- âœ… **Data Cleaning**: Automatically fixed 626 missing cable sizes and removed orphaned connections
- âœ… **Topology Validation**: Ensured radial network structure, removed cycles
- âœ… **Network Modeling**: Built complete network graph with all poles and conductors
- âœ… **Engineering Validation**: Voltage drop analysis and network integrity checks

## Areas Requiring Field Team Feedback

### ðŸ”´ **Critical Issues**

1. **Invalid Pole References (1,235 conductors skipped)**
   - Many conductors reference poles that don't exist in the data
   - Examples: "KET 305 HH1", "KET 306 HH1", "KET 307 SME"
   - **Question**: Are these future poles, data entry errors, or a naming convention issue?

2. **Disconnected Network Components (7 separate networks)**
   - The KET site appears to have 7 disconnected electrical networks
   - **Question**: Is this intentional (multiple independent feeders) or a data issue?

3. **Missing Transformer Assignments**
   - 22 transformers detected but not linked to specific poles
   - **Question**: How should transformers be mapped to poles in the field data?

### ðŸŸ¡ **Data Quality Questions**

1. **Cable Size Defaults**
   - System filled 626 missing cable sizes with "AAC_35" default
   - **Question**: What's the actual distribution of cable types used?

2. **Connection Data**
   - All 1,280 connections were marked as orphaned (no valid pole reference)
   - **Question**: How are customer connections recorded in field sheets?

3. **Coordinate Accuracy**
   - Some poles have identical or missing coordinates
   - **Question**: What's the GPS data collection process in the field?

### ðŸŸ¢ **Validation Requests**

1. **Voltage Drop Threshold**
   - Currently set to 7% maximum
   - **Question**: Is this appropriate for all sites?

2. **Load Assumptions**
   - Using 2kW default load per connection
   - **Question**: What are typical load profiles?

3. **Conductor Types**
   - System supports: AAC_50, AAC_35, AAC_25, AAC_16, ABC variants
   - **Question**: Are there other conductor types in use?

## Recommended Field Data Improvements

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Standardize pole naming**: Use consistent format (e.g., KET_XX_YYYY)
2. **Complete cable size data**: Record actual conductor types during installation
3. **Link connections to poles**: Ensure each connection references a valid pole
4. **GPS accuracy**: Verify coordinates for all poles, especially at branches

### Process Improvements:
1. **Daily data validation**: Run validation checks before submitting field sheets
2. **Transformer documentation**: Record transformer-to-pole mappings explicitly
3. **Network continuity**: Document intentional network breaks vs. data gaps

## Next Steps

### For Field Teams:
1. Review the pilot report files:
   - `KET_cleaned_data.json` - Processed network data
   - `KET_network.geojson` - Geographic network visualization
   - `KET_pilot_report.json` - Detailed analysis results

2. Provide feedback on:
   - Data collection challenges
   - Missing information types
   - Suggested system improvements

### For Development Team:
1. Implement field team feedback
2. Add data validation rules based on field constraints
3. Develop web UI for easier field data entry
4. Create real-time validation dashboard
