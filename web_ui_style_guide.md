# Web UI Style Guide -- Engineering CRUD Tool (Electricity Network Topology)

**Purpose**: Establish a consistent, accessible, and efficient UI for a
web-based engineering design tool that performs CRUD on electricity
network topology elements (substations, feeders, transformers, poles,
conductors, switches, meters, etc.).

**Audience**: Designers, frontend engineers, and QA.

**Stack Assumptions**: React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
component primitives, lucide-react icons. Alternate CSS-in-JS allowed
only for chart/canvas libs.
